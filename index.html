    <article>
    <p><strong>Chinenye Genevieve Onyema</strong>is a young talented Cloud Solutions Architect whose primary roles includes
    deploying fault tolerant, available and scalable web architectures. <em>Chinenye's</em> curiosity and passion for
    technology grew as she pursued learning software development. This broadened her understanding and gave her a holistic
    view of the software development process. She is adept at connecting the building of application software, hosting
    it on local machine and deploying/scaling it on a cloud architecture. Currently she is expanding her expertise in 
    <em>Backend software development</em> with <em><strong>AltSchool.</strong></em>

        I began my software development journey by learning about <strong>Html</strong> which serves as the foundational
        block of web architecture. <em>HTML</em> elements/tags include, but are not limited to, the following elements: 
        <em>h(heading 1,2,3,4,5,6), p(Paragraph), header, footer, div(container), section, nav, article 
        (these three are mostly used to structure a blog), strong, em, span <span>(these three are used to style text).</span></em>
        <p>The beauty of the webpages lies in the styling, which is achieved using <strong>CSS</strong>. Styling can be
        done <em>Inline</em> (as an attribute to the elements), or through Internal and External methods. <em>Internal</em> 
        involves using the style tag to target elements using the <em>"class" and "id"</em> attributes. <em>External</em> 
        styling links a css file to the html file using the link tag, placed within the head of the <em>Html</em> document.</p>
